This week, Sierra and I teamed up for the Github Collaboration assignment.  She set up my North Dakota State University (Go Bison!) file with the appropriate stats labels, and I set up her University of Massachusetts file.  It was nice to be able to go through the process of creating a branch, making and committing file changes, submitting the pull request, merging the pull request, and giving each other a high-five when it was all done.  Well, the high-five came after a bit of troubleshooting.  We had a bit of trouble getting pull requests to go in the right direction and we had a conflict issue.  It didn't help that we couldn't get Nitrous running on both of our machines.  But after we did some workarounds and resolved our issues, we got it done!  I'm looking forward to applying this collaborative process to my final project.  It will certainly make life easier.

It was challenging to make certain that the branch was created in the right place. At first there was a conflict because I was actually submitting pull requests backwards! The issue was quickly resolved though, and github and nitrous.io have become much simple to use.
