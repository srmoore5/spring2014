Overall, my meetup experience has been very positive. I think that I have gained
a more nuanced understanding of IT/hacking/coding culture. Although, it's an intrinsically
geeky group, they're pretty friendly and supportive of outsiders. Surpisingly, I even saw python
as more than a few irritating algebra equations.

I encountered other students, independent professionals, interested parties with little
to no programming experience, experts, one person with a very nice convertible(where does he work!)
and several experienced and helpful programmers/developers. At the Tripython meeting there was probably
a 70/30 split of men to women, but the ages were quite varied(a high school student was even present).
There were people with backgrounds in math, computer science, english, information science, linguistics etc.

My experience with programming has been very minimal in the past, but my impression of the field is that 
it's relatively simple to become initiated with the various languages, due to the prevalance of workshops,
meetups and courses offered both independently and academically.

In the future I anticipate incorporating python into my graphic design/web design interests.
Will I attend a meet-up in the future? Possibly, they can be cost prohibitice for students being that
many courses and groups that provide instruction are understandably pricy. I want to take web design courses
and choose another language to gain an intermediate level of functionality in. I will now have to decide which
language suits my professional goals.

I felt out of my element at times, but attending meetups is no longer daunting for me. I did not feel alienated due
to being a student, my age or my race at all. I met plenty of coders of color, a few veterans, a lesbian lady, a gamer,
a hilarious child of one of the organizers and even saw a few fellow INLS 560 people. After one meet-up I actually received messages thanking me for attending
and a few people were sent messages indicating that they were interested in networking with me. It was wonderful to see how inviting and non-competitive most 
people were to inexperienced recent converts.

Live long and hack on
